About Me:
I am a graduate student currently enrolled in Northeastern University's ALIGN program to obtain my MS degree in Computer Science. The ALIGN program allows students from backgrounds other than CS to achieve this degree. I personally have a Bachelor's degree in Biology from my undergraduate college, New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
I've worked on a few in class projects including a program that performs k-means clustering and linear regression on a set of data as well as a program a symbol recognizer program that is able to recognize basic shapes such as lines, circles, and triangles.
